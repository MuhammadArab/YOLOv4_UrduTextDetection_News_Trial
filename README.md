# Urdu Text Detection in News Videos Using YOLOv4
## Note: This is a trial version. 
## Custom Dataset <br>
A dedicated research team at NCBC UET Peshawar has prepared a large dataset of thousands of news frames extracted from several Urdu news channels. The dataset includes annotation files for YOLOv4 training. Now only a small subset of the dataset has been public for this trial version. <br>
A) Train set = 100 News Frames (Images) with annotation files <br>
B) Validation set = 15 News Frames (Images) with annotation files <br>
## Datasets Preprocessing and Training <br>
Open the given Colab Notebook and follow the steps <br>
